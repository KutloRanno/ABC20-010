	<p>While the Parthenon is the central city landmark in the Acropolis, this sacred temple has known some hardship. During its lifetime, the temple has been used as storage for munitions, converted into a church then a mosque, and widely looted by former Ambassador to Constantinople Lord Elgin. It also served as army barracks and was bombed by the Venetians in 1687.</p>

                    It was then when the incomparable Parthenon was built, when
                    sculpture and painting flourished making Athens
                    a center of intellectual life. The city enjoyed a cultural explosion that ended with the Peloponnesian War (401 BC to 431 BC), but Athenian achievements in philosophy, drama and art continued even after the city's glory faded, creating a legacy that creating a legacy that conquered the world as Hellenistic culture. During the Middle Ages, Athens experienced decline and then a recovery under the Byzantine Empire, becoming a provincial capital of the empire and a center of religious learning and devotion.
