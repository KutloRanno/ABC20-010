	<hr/>
	<p>From the late-19th century to the 1990s, the sidewalks of downtown Athens used to be paved with marble. Athens’ first female mayor, Dora Bakoyannis, decided to give the city a much-needed facelift in 2003, as the marble had aged and would get slippery on rainy days. While some of marbled sidewalks are still in place, Athenian roads and walkways were modernized, making the entire city more accessible for everyone – just in time for the 2004 Olympics.</p>

                <p>The lifestyle of the people in Athens is one of the city's major perks.Athenians are full of life and always enthusiastic to discuss philosophyical ideas(the greatest phisosophers come from Greece after all).Athenians like sitting down and socialising with friends over drinks and food. This is why Athens has a vast number of restuarants,pubs ,tarvens,ouzeries and bars. In the evening Athenians flock into these pubs and night clubs and drink and dance till dawn.
                The climate in Athens is perfect for Athenians to sit out at night in outdoor restuarants. One of the things that strike visitors is seeing people relaxing and talking over drinks with complete serenity. You'd be impressed by the passion Athenians show for politics,football and unsurprsingly philosophy, all these topics are always in their dinner conversations. </p>
